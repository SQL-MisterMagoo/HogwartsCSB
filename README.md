# Hogwarts Client Side

Check out the spells in here!

Demonstrates a way to have dynamic styles in Client side Blazor without JS.

This is a rough demo - I would not really have a timer running changing the styles.

In real life, the "Head" component would have some State that other components can interface to - to request addition/removal of styles.

Expelliamus!
